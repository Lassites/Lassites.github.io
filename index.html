                        Our users are finding it increasingly difficult to establish a real connection with another person. 
                        They find it difficult to find the “one” for them as many of these people have a hard time finding others with similar interests and goals. 
                        <br>
                        Our solution would make it so people can be matched based on similar interests that they communicate, goals they would like to achieve, to help make
                        it easier to help find that special someone who's right for you.
